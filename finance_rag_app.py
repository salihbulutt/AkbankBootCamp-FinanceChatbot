    FINANCE_DATA = """
    Asset: Any resource owned by a business or economic entity. Assets are things of value that a company owns to operate its business. Examples include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and property.
    Liability: A company's legal financial debts or obligations that arise during the course of business operations. Liabilities are settled over time through the transfer of economic benefits. Examples include accounts payable, debts, and loans.
    Equity: The value of ownership in a business or property. It is calculated by taking the total value of assets and subtracting the total value of liabilities (Assets - Liabilities = Equity).
    Bonds: A fixed-income investment in which an investor loans money to an entity (typically corporate or governmental) for a defined period at a variable or fixed interest rate.
    Inflation: A general rise in the price level of an economy over a period of time, leading to a decline in the purchasing power of money.
    Diversification: A risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio.
    Portfolio: A collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents, including mutual funds and ETFs.
    Bull Market: A market condition in which prices are rising or are expected to rise. Typically characterized by optimism and investor confidence.
    Bear Market: A market condition in which prices are falling, typically by 20% or more from recent highs, usually accompanied by pessimism and negative investor sentiment.
    Dividend: A distribution of a portion of a company's earnings to its shareholders, usually paid quarterly.
    Capital Gains: The profit earned from selling an asset for more than its purchase price.
